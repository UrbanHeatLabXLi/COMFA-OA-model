DOI: [DOI link]

The COMFA-OA model extends the original COMFA framework to account for the specific thermal comfort and heat exposure of older adults (55+) in urban environments.

ðŸ”§ Features

- Implementation of the COMFA-OA thermal comfort index tailored for older adults
- Required microclimate inputs: air temperature (Ta), mean radiant temperature (Tmrt), wind speed, relative humidity
- Required human paramters: height(m), weight(kg),

Incorporation of energy balance components: radiation, convection, evaporation, conduction
